# php-codes

A repository containing my simple PHP apps.

## Contents

1. password generator: Generate cryptographically safe passwords (AJAX request)
2. simple payments: Payment form with validation (format, Luhn-algorithm, valid date etc.) exchange valutes from HUF to EUR with an API: https://free.currencyconverterapi.com/
3. user profile: User profile class, creating v4 uuids, passwords, hashes (needs more safe method for generating pwds!), save data to CSV and JSON
4. Get current weather at your city with Open Weather API (free): https://openweathermap.org/current. You need to place your api key into weather.php -> line 14

More to come soon...
Next app I will create is: Image gallery app with lightbox!
