# php-codes

A repository containing my simple PHP apps.

## Contents

1. password generator: Generate cryptographically safe passwords (AJAX request)
2. simple payments: Payment form with validation (format, Luhn-algorithm, valid date etc.) exchange valutes from HUF to EUR with an API: https://free.currencyconverterapi.com/
3. user profile: User profile class, creating v4 uuids, passwords, hashes (needs more safe method for generating pwds!), save data to CSV and JSON

More to come soon...
Next app I will create is: Get current weather at your town/city with an API.

**Usage**

- XAMPP: just copy the files inside the */htdocs* folder
- Laragon: put the files into */www* folder
- Or use the dev environment of your choice.
